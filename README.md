# lsst.validate.base

**Deprecated measurement framework for performance metrics.**

This package is deprecated; please refer to [lsst.verify](https://github.com/lsst/verify).

Packages can use `lsst.validate.base` to report metric measurements to LSST Data Management's [SQUASH](https://squash.lsst.codes) dashboard.
This package is part of the [LSST Science Pipelines](https://pipelines.lsst.io).

`lsst.validate.base` provides:

- A schema for defining performance **metrics** (things that *can* be measured) and **specifications** (threshold values of a metric). The `lsst.validate.base.Metric` and `lsst.validate.base.Specification` classes provide Python access to metrics and specifications.
- An `lsst.validate.base.MeasurementBase` base class that can be inherited to make **measurement** classes. Measurement classes create well-structured self-describing datasets that track units, input datasets, and even measurement code parameters.
- An `lsst.validate.base.BlobBase` base class that can be inherited to make **blobs**: containers for semantically rich data.
- An `lsst.validate.base.Job` class that collects multiple measurements, their metrics, and blob datasets, and provides a JSON file that can be submitted to [SQUASH](https://squash.lsst.codes).
